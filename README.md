# dementia_risk_factors

“Someone develops dementia every three seconds and the current annual cost of dementia is estimated
at US $1trillion, a figure set to double by 2030” (2019 World Alzheimers report). With dementia being
such a complex degenerative disease this paper hopes to better understand the risk factors associated
with it and how they may vary across countries given differing cultural and socio-economic standards.
The paper analyses the easySHARE data set consisting of surveys over 16 years across countries in
Europe. After the advanced imputation of variables, given the varying levels of missingness in the
data we use causal discovery algorithms through the bnlearn package to identify DAGs for 5 countries
and their marginal probability distributions. We find that higher depression levels increase the risk
of severe dementia in Eastern European countries, unlike that of mainland Europe. Our findings also
suggest that education levels and age are risk factors for all countries and for certain countries gender
has an indirect role in the risk of developing severe dementia.
